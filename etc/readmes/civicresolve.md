    const result = await processRequest()
    
    endTimer() // Automatically records performance metrics
    return Response.json(result)
  } catch (error) {
    endTimer() // Ensures metrics are recorded even on errors
    throw error
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization Features

#### 🎯 Redis Caching System (Enterprise-Grade)

CivicResolve implements a sophisticated Redis-based caching system designed for enterprise performance and reliability:

##### **Core Architecture**
```typescript
// lib/server-cache.ts - Production-ready Redis implementation
import Redis from 'ioredis'

const redis = new Redis({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST || 'localhost',
  port: parseInt(process.env.REDIS_PORT || '6379'),
  retryDelayOnFailover: 100,
  maxRetriesPerRequest: 3,
  lazyConnect: true
})
```

##### **Smart Cache Invalidation System**
Advanced multi-pattern cache invalidation ensures data freshness:

```typescript
// Multi-pattern invalidation for precise cache management
async function serverCacheInvalidate(tags: string[]) {
  const patterns = [
    ...tags.map(tag => `${tag}*`),        // Keys starting with tag
    ...tags.map(tag => `*${tag}*`),       // Keys containing tag  
    ...tags.map(tag => `*${tag}`)         // Keys ending with tag
  ]
  
  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const keys = await redis.keys(pattern)
    if (keys.length > 0) {
      await redis.del(...keys)
      console.log(`🧹 [CACHE] Invalidated ${keys.length} keys matching: ${pattern}`)
    }
  }
}
```

##### **Comprehensive Cache Logging**
Enterprise-grade debugging with detailed operation visibility:

```typescript
// Real-time cache operation logging
export async function serverCacheGet<T>(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
  console.log(`🔍 [CACHE] Looking for cache key: ${key}`)
  
  const cached = await redis.get(key)
  if (cached) {
    console.log(`✅ [CACHE] CACHE HIT for key: ${key}`)
    console.log(`⚡ [CACHE] Serving cached data (Size: ~${(cached.length/1024).toFixed(1)}KB)`)
    return JSON.parse(cached)
  }
  
  console.log(`❌ [CACHE] CACHE MISS for key: ${key}`)
  return null
}
```

##### **Performance-Optimized Caching**
Strategic caching implementation across all API endpoints:

```typescript
// Example: Issues API with intelligent caching
export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const filters = extractFilters(request)
  const cacheKey = `issues:${filters.category}:${filters.status}:${filters.sort}:${filters.page}:${JSON.stringify(filters.priorities)}`
  
  // Try cache first
  const cached = await serverCacheGet<any>(cacheKey)
  if (cached) {
    console.log(`⚡ [GET] Serving cached data (Age: ${cached.age}s)`)
    return NextResponse.json(cached)
  }
  
  // Cache miss - fetch fresh data
  console.log(`🏃 [GET] Cache miss - fetching fresh data from database`)
  const freshData = await fetchFromDatabase(filters)
  
  // Cache for 5 minutes
  await serverCacheSet(cacheKey, freshData, 300)
  return NextResponse.json(freshData)
}
```

##### **Cache Invalidation Triggers**
Automatic cache invalidation on data changes:

- **New Issue Creation**: Invalidates `['issues', 'stats', 'analytics']`
- **Status Updates**: Invalidates `['issues', 'stats', 'analytics']`  
- **Vote Changes**: Invalidates `['issues', 'stats']`
- **Comment Addition**: Invalidates `['issues', 'comments']`
- **Issue Assignment**: Invalidates `['issues', 'stats', 'analytics']`

##### **Cache Performance Monitoring**
Real-time cache performance visibility:

```bash
# Console output examples during operation:

# Cache Hit (Fast Response)
✅ [CACHE] CACHE HIT for key: issues:all:all:newest:1:[]
⚡ [GET] Serving cached data (Age: 45s, Size: ~8.5KB)

# Cache Miss (Database Query)  
❌ [CACHE] CACHE MISS for key: issues:all:all:newest:1:[]
🏃 [GET] Cache miss - fetching fresh data from database
📊 [GET] Database query returned 25 issues
💾 [CACHE] Storing data (TTL: 300s, Size: ~8.5KB)

# Cache Invalidation (Data Change)
🆕 [POST] New issue created with ID: 456
🗑️ [POST] **CACHE INVALIDATION TRIGGERED** - New issue created
🧹 [CACHE] Invalidated 12 keys matching patterns
✅ [POST] Cache invalidation completed - fresh data will be fetched
```
